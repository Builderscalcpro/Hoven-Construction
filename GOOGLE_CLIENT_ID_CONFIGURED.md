# ✅ Google OAuth Client ID Configured

**Date:** October 9, 2025

## Google Client ID Added

The real Google OAuth Client ID has been added to `.env.example`:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=309881425631-rlso29r8fj72194v07n1j5eo5sspa7ck.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_BUSINESS_PROFILE_CLIENT_ID=309881425631-rlso29r8fj72194v07n1j5eo5sspa7ck.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

## ✅ Now Functional

With this Client ID, the following components are now fully operational:

1. **Google Calendar OAuth** - Users can connect their Google Calendar
2. **Google Business Profile OAuth** - Connect to Google Business Profile
3. **Calendar Sync** - Bidirectional sync with Google Calendar
4. **Review Management** - Fetch and respond to Google reviews
5. **Business Info Sync** - Sync business information from Google

## ⚠️ Still Missing

To complete full functionality, you still need:

1. **VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY** - For Google APIs (Maps, Places, etc.)
2. **VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY** - For payment processing

## Next Steps

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you haven't already
2. Add the remaining API keys when available
3. Restart your development server to load the new environment variables
