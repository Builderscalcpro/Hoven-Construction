## Policy Patterns Implemented

### 1. User-Specific Access
Tables where users can only access their own data:
- customers, user_profiles, projects, invoices
- calendar_events, notification_settings, notes
- All token tables (google, outlook, apple)

### 2. Public Read, Authenticated Write
Tables with public visibility but protected writes:
- blog_posts, google_reviews, chatbot_knowledge_base
- sitemap_config

### 3. Role-Based Access
Tables accessible to authenticated users:
- consultations, email_templates, payments
- document_classifications, response_templates

### 4. Contractor-Specific Access
Tables for contractor portal:
- contractors, time_entries, contractor_onboarding
- contractor_messages, progress_reports

## Security Benefits

✅ **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own records
✅ **Token Protection**: OAuth tokens secured per user
✅ **Public Content**: Blog and reviews accessible to all
✅ **Contractor Separation**: Contractor data isolated from customers
✅ **Admin Flexibility**: Authenticated users have appropriate access

## Next Steps

1. Test RLS policies with different user roles
2. Verify service role bypass for edge functions
3. Monitor policy performance
4. Add additional policies as needed for specific features
5. Document any custom access patterns

## Verification

Run this query to verify RLS status:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity as rls_enabled, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE pg_policies.tablename = pg_tables.tablename) as policies
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

All tables should show `rls_enabled: true` with appropriate policy counts.
