# Aging in Place Remodeling: Create a Safe, Comfortable Home for Life

Aging in place—remaining in your home as you grow older—is the preference for 90% of seniors. This comprehensive guide covers modifications that enhance safety, accessibility, and comfort while maintaining your home's beauty and value.

## Why Plan for Aging in Place?

The average cost of assisted living is $54,000 annually, while nursing homes average $108,000. Strategic home modifications costing $10,000-$50,000 enable comfortable, independent living for years or decades.
