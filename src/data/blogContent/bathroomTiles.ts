- Classic subway tile (3"x6") remains popular

### Small Format Tiles (Under 6"x6")
- Better for shower floors (slip resistance)

- Conform to curves and angles
- More grout maintenance required

## Tile Finish Options

- Reflects maximum light
- Easy to clean

- Hides water spots and soap scum
- Slip-resistant

## Color and Pattern Trends 2025

### Neutral Palettes
White, gray, beige, and taupe create timeless, spa-like atmospheres that appeal to broad audiences.

### Bold Patterns
Geometric designs, Moroccan-inspired patterns, and encaustic tiles add personality and visual interest.

### Natural Tones
Earth tones, terracotta, and warm neutrals bring organic warmth to bathroom spaces.

### Monochromatic Schemes
Using varying shades of one color creates sophisticated, cohesive designs.

## Layout Patterns

### Subway Pattern
Classic brick-style layout, timeless and versatile

### Herringbone
Diagonal pattern adds movement and sophistication

### Chevron
Similar to herringbone but with pointed edges

### Vertical Stack
Modern, clean lines create height illusion

### Diagonal
Makes small spaces appear larger

### Basketweave
Intricate pattern using rectangular tiles

## Practical Considerations

### Slip Resistance
Critical for safety, especially in showers. Look for tiles with textured surfaces or matte finishes. The coefficient of friction (COF) should be at least 0.60 for wet areas.

### Water Absorption
Choose tiles with low water absorption rates (porcelain, glass) for wet areas. Natural stone requires proper sealing.

### Maintenance Requirements
Consider your lifestyle and cleaning preferences. Glossy tiles show water spots but clean easily. Textured tiles hide dirt but are harder to clean.

### Grout Selection
Epoxy grout resists staining and mildew better than traditional cement grout. Darker grout colors hide stains better but may show soap residue.
