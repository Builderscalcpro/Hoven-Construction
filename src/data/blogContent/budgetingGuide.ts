Planning a home renovation requires more than just picking out pretty finishes. A comprehensive budget protects you from financial stress and ensures your project's success. This guide walks you through creating a realistic, detailed renovation budget.

## The 20% Rule: Your Safety Net

Always add 20% to your estimated costs for contingencies. Unexpected issues like hidden water damage, outdated wiring, or structural problems appear in 80% of renovation projects.

**Example:**
- Estimated project cost: $50,000
- 20% contingency: $10,000
- Total budget needed: $60,000

## Step 1: Define Your Project Scope

### Create a Detailed Wish List
List everything you want to accomplish:
- Structural changes (walls, windows, doors)
- Mechanical updates (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)
- Finishes (flooring, cabinets, countertops)
- Fixtures and appliances
- Lighting and hardware

### Prioritize Your Needs
Categorize items as:
- **Must-Have**: Essential functional improvements
- **Nice-to-Have**: Desired upgrades
- **Dream Items**: Luxury additions if budget allows

### Research Realistic Costs
Gather estimates for each component:
- Online cost calculators
- Contractor consultations
- Material supplier quotes
- Similar project examples

## Step 2: Break Down Your Budget

### Typical Budget Allocation

**Kitchen Renovation:**
- Cabinets: 30-40%
- Appliances: 15-20%
- Countertops: 10-15%
- Labor: 20-35%

- Lighting/Fixtures: 5-10%

**Bathroom Renovation:**

## Step 3: Understand All Cost Categories

### Hard Costs (70-80% of budget)
Tangible materials and labor:
- Materials and supplies

- Insurance and bonds (1-2%)

### Hidden Costs

## Step 6: Create Your Budget Spreadsheet

## Step 7: Cost-Saving Strategies

- Holiday sales for appliances
- End-of-line material discounts

**Material Choices:**
