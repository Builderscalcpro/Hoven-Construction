Not all home improvements deliver equal returns. Understanding which projects provide the best ROI helps you make strategic decisions about where to invest your renovation dollars, whether you're planning to sell soon or simply want to maximize your home's value.

## Understanding ROI in Home Renovations

### What is ROI?
Return on Investment (ROI) measures how much value a renovation adds compared to its cost.

**Formula:**
ROI = (Value Added / Cost) × 100

**Example:**
- Kitchen remodel cost: $50,000
- Value added: $35,000
- ROI: ($35,000 / $50,000) × 100 = 70%

### Factors Affecting ROI
