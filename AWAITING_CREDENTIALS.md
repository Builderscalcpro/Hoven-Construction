# Awaiting Google Credentials

## What I Need

To complete the Google Business Profile and Google Calendar integration, please provide:

### 1. Google OAuth Client ID
- Format: `XXXXXXXXX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Found in: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials

### 2. Google API Key
- Format: `AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
- Found in: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials

### 3. (Optional) Google Business Profile Client ID
- If different from the OAuth Client ID above
- Same format as OAuth Client ID

## How to Share Them

Please paste them in this format:

```
Google OAuth Client ID: [your-client-id].apps.googleusercontent.com
Google API Key: AIzaSy[your-api-key]
Google Business Client ID (if different): [client-id].apps.googleusercontent.com
```

## What I'll Do Once Received

1. ✅ Update `.env.example` with your credentials
2. ✅ Verify all redirect URIs are correctly configured
3. ✅ Test Google Calendar OAuth flow
4. ✅ Test Google Business Profile connection
5. ✅ Verify bidirectional calendar sync is operational
6. ✅ Create verification report showing all systems are working

## Security Note

These credentials will be added to `.env.example` as a template. For production:
- Add them to your actual `.env` file (which is gitignored)
- Add them to Supabase Edge Function secrets
- Never commit actual credentials to version control
