**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify environment variable
echo $VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

npm run dev
```

### "Stripe is not configured" Error
**Cause:** Publishable key not loaded

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Key starts with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_`
3. No extra spaces or quotes
4. Restart dev server

### Payment Fails Silently
**Check:**
1. Supabase Edge Function logs
2. Stripe dashboard for declined payments
3. Browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Network tab for failed requests

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check Supabase logs
supabase functions logs process-payment

# Check Stripe events
# Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/events
```

### 3D Secure Not Working
**Note:** 3D Secure requires:
- Test card: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
- Stripe Elements (full integration)
- Webhook for payment confirmation

**Current Implementation:**
